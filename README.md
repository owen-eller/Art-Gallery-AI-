## Overview

The **Art Gallery AI Chatbot** is an intelligent conversational assistant designed to help users explore museum exhibitions, artists, and artworks. Built using **LangChain**, **OpenAI GPT models**, and a lightweight **Streamlit** interface, the chatbot simulates the experience of interacting with a knowledgeable gallery guide.

Users can ask questions such as:

* *“Tell me about Monet.”*
* *“What’s in the Modern Art exhibition?”*
* *“What is Impressionism?”*

The chatbot responds with short, accurate information sourced from a custom dataset and optimized prompt engineering.

* **Conversational AI** using GPT-3.5 Turbo
* **Custom prompt engineering** ensuring friendly, expert, 2–3 sentence responses
* **Streamlit Web UI** with chat history
* **Custom local API** (`gallery_api.py`) with curated artist & exhibition info
* **LangChain LLMChain** for predictable responses
* **Logging & error handling** for fault tolerance
* **Modular codebase** that can be easily extended

## Architecture

```text
User → Streamlit UI → LangChain LLMChain → Prompt Template → OpenAI GPT Model → Response
                          ↓
                  gallery_api.py (Artist & Exhibit Info)
```

Each component is modular, making it easy to expand with real museum APIs, databases, image models, or RAG pipelines.

## Usage

1. Type any question about artists, exhibitions, or artworks
2. The chatbot generates a concise, friendly answer
3. Chat history appears below the response
4. All interactions are logged in `chatbot.log`

## Prompt Engineering Design

The chatbot uses a structured LangChain prompt:

```
You are an expert art gallery assistant.  
Answer politely and provide interesting details about exhibitions, artists, or artworks.  
Keep the answer 2–3 sentences long.

User: {question}
Assistant:
```

This ensures 
* Consistent tone
* Factual responses
* Controlled length
* Avoidance of hallucination

## Error Handling & Logging

* If API key is missing → App stops and displays error
* Exceptions are caught and surfaced to UI
* `chatbot.log` records:

  * User questions
  * Model responses
  * Error traces

Example log entry:

```
2025-02-14 10:33:21 - INFO - User asked: Tell me about Monet.
